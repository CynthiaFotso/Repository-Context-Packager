# Repository-Context-Packager

This is a command-line tool that analyzes a local Git repository and generates a single, formatted text file containing repository context.
This makes it easier to share your project with Large Language Models instead of copy-pasting files one by one, you can provide a single package that includes:

- Project location
- Git commit information
- Directory structure
- File contents (with syntax highlighting)
- Summary statistics

---

## Features

- Package entire repositories, specific directories, or individual files
- Display Git info (commit hash, branch, author, date)
- Show project structure as a tree
- Include file contents with syntax highlighting
- Provide summary statistics (total files, total lines)
- Save to a file (`--output`) 
- Optional file filtering with `--include` patterns
- Automatically skips `node_modules` and hidden files

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version 18 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** installed and available in your system PATH

---

## Installation
Follow the below instructions step-by-step.

Clone the repository and install globally with dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/CynthiaFotso/Repository-Context-Packager.git
cd Repository-Context-Packager
npm install
npm link (#This allows you to run repo-packager from anywhere in your terminal. This step is optional; you can also run the tool using node ./bin/cli.js)
```

Now you can run the tool globally in your terminal with the command:
```
repo-packager
```

---

## Usage

# Package only JavaScript files
repo-packager . --include "*.js"
```

For the basic command line interface,

# To print the tool name and version
repo-packager --version
repo-packager -V

# To print usage information
